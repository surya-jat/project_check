# Real-Time Connection with Database using Web Sockets

This project demonstrates a real-time connection with a MongoDB database using web sockets. The project uses two methods:

1. **Socket.IO, Express.js, and MongoDB**: This method uses Socket.IO to monitor user activity. When a user submits the form present in `/static/template/index.html`, the user data is collected with a socket, emitted, and saved to MongoDB. The relevant files for this method are `app.js` and `/static/template/index.html`.

2. **Pug Template Engine, Express, and MongoDB**: This method uses the POST method of the form from `/static/template/index.pug` to get the user data. The data is then saved to MongoDB. The relevant files for this method are `app.js` (commented part), `/static/template/index.pug`, and `/static/style/form.css`.
